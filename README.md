The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median income in Carlifornia using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median income in any district, given all the other metrics.

Districts or block groups are the smallest geographical units for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3, 000 people).
